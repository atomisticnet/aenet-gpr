Dear Nong and Alex,

In today's meeting, we discussed steps to take in order to develop an automated workflow for data generation that can be used to train ANN potentials in aenet. The steps are:  

1. Combine BOSS, ASE and Catlearn tools to build an efficient sampling method able to combine both energy and force information while sampling DFT data.
2. Make also use of other sampling methods, such as normal mode sampling.
3. Integrate methodology to aenet (via python interface) to enable active learning.

Immediate steps are:  

1. Start with BOSS --> Generate DFT database sampled with BOSS for two-layer Li(100) surface with EC molecule adsorbate.
2. Choose settings for above DFT calculations (k-grid, vdW).
3. Output sampled structures in XSF format.
4. Assess accuracy of resulting PES by comparing to DFT energies.

Thank you and all the best,

Annika
