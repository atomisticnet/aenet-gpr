Conclusions from today's meeting:

Steps done so far:
1. Generated DFT data with BOSS for 2-layer Li(100)|EC interface (sampling with 2D and 3D BOSS models finished; sampling with 6D model ongoing).
2. Generated control.in files with tight settings, vdW interactions and accurate k-grid settings for Li and Li|EC.
3. Saved sampled structures in aenet-XSF format.

Next steps:
1. Add code to github repository (ongoing).
2. Validate the sampled structures by comparing them to fully relaxed structures in DFT.
3. Assess accuracy of BOSS surrogate model: Use BOSS model to predict energies of new (random) EC configurations that were not sampled, then compare with DFT energies (something similar is already done within the BOSS postprocessing routine, but for the global minimum prediction: For every iteration, the predicted energy corresponding to the predicted optimal EC position is compared to the DFT energy at the same minimum EC position that was predicted by BOSS).
4. Add existing literature to Zotero that model or describe the interface between Lithium surface and electrolyte molecules to better understand the mechanisms at the interface (decomposition, shape of surface etc.).
5. Build GPR model with Catlearn that are is to predict both energies and forces (meeting on Monday).
