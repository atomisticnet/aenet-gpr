Conclusion from today's meeting: The PBE functional does not accurately describe the EC decomposition on lithium. We would like to use a hybrid functional (implemented in FHI-aims code, with tight settings+vdW), but we don't know yet which one works best.

To do in order of importance:

- **First, Annika**: Perform DFT benchmark computations for the EC-Li-RO structure adsorbed on the lithium slab (100 surface) structure using 3 different functionals (HSE06+TS, PBE0+TS, SCAN0+TS.
  **Structures: Li100-3x3-7L-01EC.in**
- **Second, Annika+Cem+Alex**: Perform NEB computations (with Cem's help) to find the transition state of EC decomposition and to obtain the reaction energies. These energies can be compared with the DFT energies from the QM team.
- **Third, Nong+Annika**: Run AIMD (T=300K) using these HSE06+TS, PBE0+TS, SCAN0+TS functionals to learn about the reaction mechanism with temperature effect.
  **Structures: Li100-3x3-7L-01EC.in and Li100-3x3-7L-02EC.in**
